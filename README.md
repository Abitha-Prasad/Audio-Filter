- Audio Filter using MATLAB

This project demonstrates how to apply low-pass and high-pass filters to audio signals using MATLAB. It also includes a feature to convert `.mp3` audio files to `.wav` for processing.

🔧 Features
- Convert `.mp3` to `.wav`
- Apply low-pass and high-pass filters
- Visualize original and filtered signals
- Play original and filtered audio in MATLAB

📂 Files
- `audio_filter_project.m` – Main MATLAB script
- `raw-noise.mp3` – Example input file

▶️ How to Use
1. Upload your `.mp3` file to MATLAB Online.
2. Run `audio_filter_project.m` to:
   - Convert it to `.wav`
   - Filter the audio
   - Visualize and listen to the output

🧰 Tools Used
- MATLAB Online
- Built-in `audioread`, `audiowrite`, `sound`, and filter functions
